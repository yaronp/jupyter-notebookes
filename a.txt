Rebasing works by transferring each local commit to the updated master branch one at a time. 
This means that you catch merge conflicts on a commit-by-commit basis rather than resolving all of them in one massive merge commit. 
This keeps your commits as focused as possible and makes for a clean project history. 
In turn, this makes it much easier to figure out where bugs were introduced and, if necessary, to roll back changes with minimal impact on the project.
